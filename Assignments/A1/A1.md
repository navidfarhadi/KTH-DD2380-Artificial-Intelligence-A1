# Question 1
$\pi = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix}$, $A = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5 \\ 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix}$, $B = \begin{pmatrix} 0.9 \ 0.1 \\ 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix}$

# Question 2
$\pi \cdot A = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5 \\ 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix}$

# Question 3
$\pi \cdot A \cdot B = \begin{pmatrix} 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix} \cdot \begin{pmatrix} 0.9 \ 0.1 \\ 0.5 \ 0.5\end{pmatrix} = \begin{pmatrix} 0.7 \ 0.3 \end{pmatrix}$

# Question 4
This is a consequence of the chain rule, also known as the product rule, which states that $P(A,B) = P(B|A) \cdot P(A)$. In this example, $A = ((O_{1:t-1} = o_{1:t-1}) \cap (X_t=x_i))$ and $B = (O_t = o_t)$.

# Question 5
The number of values of $\delta$ and $\delta^{idx}$ is $T \cdot N.$

# Question 6
The di-gamma function is the probability of being in state $X_t = i$ and transitioning to state $X_{t+1} = j$ at time point $t$ given the emission sequence and the HMM. As a result of this, you have to compute the way through $X_t = i$ to get to ${X_{t+1} = j}$ divided by all possible ways through the entire HMM, given the emission sequence, which is equal to $\sum_{k=1}^{N} \alpha_T(k)$. We basically want to calculate the ratio between one way and all ways.

# Question 7
The algorithm never converges with the given observation sequences and HMM parameters. You would need more than 10000 observations to see a convergance, if it will even converge. If the probability of the emmision sequence does not increase then the algorithm converges.
